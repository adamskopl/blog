# Thoughts on code readability

How big a deal code readability is?

## What kind of 'readability'?

Code not readable could be, for example, a code hard to follow. Maybe because of hard to understand nested `if else` clauses. Or because of a lack of dividing code into functions, which names would be more explanatory. Such code can be understood, but requires focused analysis. Its readability can be achieved by code refactoring.

But there's also another type of non-readable code. It's a code that **fails to explain what it does**.

## Reasons

From some time I'm quite skeptical about the statement, that "one of the benefits of unit tests is code documentation". That "if you don't know 'whats' and 'whys' of the code, check unit tests for answers". Of course, securing requirements with tests is a good idea. What bothers me, is the tendency of not caring enough about a code being self-explanatory. Passing that responsibility on unit tests is one of the excuses.

Problem is often visible when working with legacy code. We see a fragment and it's not clear, what's its purpose. So we leave it alone because we don't want to mess something up. Besides, people usually don't want to improve the code's readability in legacy code. "I don't have to understand it, someone probably had a good reason to write it". And a mysterious fragment of code lives forever happily after.

Bad code reviews also go hand in hand with producing non-readable code. From my experience, people very often only check, if variables have good names, if the solution is written accordingly to the framework's standards, or if it can be written more cleverly. They don't pay enough attention, to understand what the code does, they just want to check if it looks good. After that, code review is marked as 'accepted' and an author of a solution merges it, missing the last moment for future confusion prevention.

## Example

Some time ago, I've encountered the situation, when during refactoring and writing missing tests, the non readable code caused the need of an addition investigation. It was a file's `dragover` event handler and it performed an initial validation, displaying either a success or an error. It went something like this:

```js
function someFileDragOverHandler(event) {
  if (event.dataTransfer) {
    if (event.dataTransfer.items && event.dataTransfer.items.length > 0) {
      const draggeedItem = event.dataTransfer.items[0];
      if (isItemOk(draggeedItem)) {
        showSuccess();
      } else {
        showError();
      }
    } else {
      showSuccess();
    }
  }
}
```

I wanted to write unit tests, which would check if `showSuccess()` or `showError()` are called properly. But first, I had to understand **when** success or error should be displayed. Basing only on the code, the understanding should go like this:
- if `event.dataTransfer` is falsy, show neither error nor success
- if `event.dataTransfer.items` is falsy or has no elements, show success
- otherwise, perform check on an item, call either showSuccess() or showError()

I don't remember why, but there was a reason for that particular situation to check `dataTransfer`. If not available, something should happen, though. Right? **Where is the 'else' clause?** If something is checked, then obviously it could happen. What then? In this situation, nothing would happen: the user would get neither success nor error.

Why `event.dataTransfer.items` and `event.dataTransfer.items.length` are checked? If a check fails, why the 'success' is displayed? It turned out, that [DataTransferItemList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API/File_drag_and_drop) is not supported everywhere. More precisely (surprise, surprise) it's not supported by IE. The project required IE support, so `items` property had to be checked. Additionally `items` [could have](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransferItemList) length of 0. Displaying 'success' was a fallback, assuming that later parsing code would handle a file being invalid.

## Improving readability

So the code was not readable, because:
- There was no `else` for `dataTransfer` check.
- When it comes to `items`, it could be not obvious, that it's browser support that is checked and not something else.

I refactored the code a little bit, leaving it, in my opinion, more readable:

```js
 function someFileDragOverHandler(event) {
  const dataTransferItems = event.dataTransfer.items;
  const dataTransferItemListSupported =
        (dataTransferItems !== undefined && dataTransferItems.length > 0);
  const draggedItemVaild = dataTransferItemListSupported && isItemValid(dataTransferItems[0]);

  if (draggedItemVaild || !dataTransferItemListSupported) {
    showSuccess();
  } else {
    showError();
  }
}
```

- code could be shorter, but I wanted to show explicitly, that `DataTransferItemList` support should be checked
- conditions for showing success or an error are short and quick to understand

Through that simple example, I wanted to demonstrate, how an unreadable code:
- adds extra time, needed to understand it,
- increases complexity,
- doesn't explain what it does,
- is prone to generate errors
